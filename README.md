After importing a current list of the S&P500 stocks, the one-year price return was used to generate a shortlist of low quality high momentum stocks. Following the initial analysis, the one-year price return, six-month price return, three-month price return, and one-month price return were all considered to generate a shortlist of high quality momentum stocks. The high quality momentum stocks were exported to Excel and reformatted within Python.
